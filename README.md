# gravity-forms-duplicate-prevention
This plugin is a fork and an update from the original plugin here : https://github.com/buckii/gravity-forms-duplicate-prevention
The client side script has been removed as submits by clicking twice on button has been handled by Gravity Forms.
The plugin works on Wordpress 6.1 and Gravity Forms 2.7.1
